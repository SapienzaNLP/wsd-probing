		7 - Dist: 0.6157562136650085 It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision .
		|
		8 - Dist: 0.7404597401618958 Therefore , if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .
