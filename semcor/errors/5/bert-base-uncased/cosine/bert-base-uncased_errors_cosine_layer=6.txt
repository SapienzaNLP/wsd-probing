		1 - Dist: 0.9001264572143555 The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .

		2 - Dist: 0.9008607864379883 In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder .
