		1 - Dist: 0.9544376730918884 In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E. F. Smith + Townsend ) Conn , on sweet clover stems .
