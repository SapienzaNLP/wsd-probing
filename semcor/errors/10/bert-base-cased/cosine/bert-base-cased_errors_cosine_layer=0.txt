		|
		14 - Dist: 0.5338486433029175 The publication last July of the party 's Draft Program - that blueprint for the `` transition to communism '' - had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i. e. , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group '' ) in all theoretical party journals .

		|
		4 - Dist: 0.6424953937530518 Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor .
		|
		5 - Dist: 0.6456568837165833 It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors .
		|
		6 - Dist: 0.6472043991088867 They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level .
		|
		7 - Dist: 0.6754552125930786 While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior .
