		1 - Dist: 0.9044886827468872 Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography .

		1 - Dist: 0.9032278656959534 The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .

		2 - Dist: 0.9268836379051208 In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder .
