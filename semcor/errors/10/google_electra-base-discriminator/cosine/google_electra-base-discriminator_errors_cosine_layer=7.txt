L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity '' - despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .

		1 - Dist: 0.8543437719345093 The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors .

		2 - Dist: 0.8727071285247803 In our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder .
