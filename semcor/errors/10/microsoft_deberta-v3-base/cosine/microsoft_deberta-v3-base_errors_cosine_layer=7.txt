		2 - Dist: 0.9120360016822815 After passing * * f through DEAE-cellulose , the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring tests by R. F. Whitcomb ) ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining .

		2 - Dist: 0.9004296064376831 After * * f and * * f were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present .
