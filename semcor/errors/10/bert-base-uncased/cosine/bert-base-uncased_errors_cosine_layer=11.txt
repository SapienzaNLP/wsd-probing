		1 - Dist: 0.908667802810669 Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at * * f .
		|
		2 - Dist: 0.8068435192108154 When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced .
		|
		3 - Dist: 0.7525335550308228 It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source .

		7 - Dist: 0.8619250059127808 Carrier * * f was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide ) .
		|
		8 - Dist: 0.8787957429885864 Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20 % aqueous sodium iodide solution .
		|
		9 - Dist: 0.7643553018569946 The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell .
