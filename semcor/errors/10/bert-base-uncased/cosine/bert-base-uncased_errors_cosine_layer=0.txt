		6 - Dist: 0.6244451403617859 They felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level .

		|
		8 - Dist: 0.6618989706039429 Instructions to relax , i. e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given .

		|
		14 - Dist: 0.6181374788284302 But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism '' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .
