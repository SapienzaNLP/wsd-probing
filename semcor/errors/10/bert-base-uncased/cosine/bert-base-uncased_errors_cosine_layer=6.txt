		1 - Dist: 0.7549599409103394 While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion .
		|
		2 - Dist: 0.601860523223877 It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below .
		|
		3 - Dist: 0.5753403902053833 It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors .
		|
		4 - Dist: 0.6583439707756042 It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors .

		5 - Dist: 0.8189495801925659 This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai ^ ve state but not in the first .
		|
		6 - Dist: 0.6368249654769897 While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior .
		|
		7 - Dist: 0.725754976272583 A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax , since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as `` normal '' .
		|
		8 - Dist: 0.7813605666160583 Autosuggestibility , the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome ( i. e. , that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects ' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening ( e. g. , of becoming dizzy and maybe falling , an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects ) .
		|
		9 - Dist: 0.8277585506439209 Four subjects ( 10 % ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not .

		3 - Dist: 0.7322098612785339 It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .
